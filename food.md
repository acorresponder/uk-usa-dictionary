**Lemonade** | Sprite | Sprite seems to be a generic enough term that you'll get what you want even if it's not actually Sprite.

## Ingredients

UK  | US  | Notes
--- | --- | ---
Caster sugar | Superfine sugar |
Icing sugar | Powdered/Confectioner's sugar |
Cornflour | Cornstarch | There's also a "cornflour" in the US, but it's not what you're looking for.
Self-raising flour | 150g plain flour + 2tsp baking powder | You can find "self-rising flour" in the US but it has extra salt compared to the UK one, so try to avoid.
Gelatine leaves (6) | Gelatin powder sachet (7g) | You'll also need to pre-soak the powder first and dissolve it.
