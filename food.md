# Food & Cooking

## Food

UK  | US  | Notes

Aubergine | Eggplant |
**Bacon** | Back bacon | Almost impossible to find in the US. "Canadian bacon" is somewhat similar.
Beetroot | Beet |

? | **Biscuit** | A scone-like savoury quickbread, commonly used as a side dish at breakfast.
Candyfloss | Cotton candy |
**Chips** | French/Steak fries | French fries are thin; steak fries are thick.
Chocolate bar | Candy bar |
Courgette | Zucchini |
Crisps | **Chips** | The US also seems to have only 4ish flavours, too.
? | Half-and-half | Half milk, half light cream. Do not confuse with semi-skimmed milk.
Ice Lolly | Popsicle |
Jam | Jelly |
Macaroni cheese | Mac and cheese |
Mixed spice | Baking spice | Or maybe even pumpkin spice.
Porridge | (Cooked) Oatmeal |
Prawn | Small shrimp | Don't even ask about prawn cocktail crisps.
Profiterole | Cream puff | Also called profiterole in the US.
**Rapeseed oil** | Canola oil | Can sound very bad out of context in the US.
Semi-skimmed milk | Reduced fat (2%) milk | The US also has a 1% fat milk for which there is no traditional UK equivalent.
Streaky bacon | **Bacon** | The overwhelmingly dominant kind in the US.
Sweets | Candy |
Treacle | Molasses |
Tomato sauce | Ketchup | Ketchup is used in the UK too.
White sauce | **Gravy** | Gravy in the US is a more general term for anything gloopy you pour on food.

Notes:
* In the US an **entree** is a main course. In the UK, an *entree* is a starter.
* UK Cheddar cheese and US Cheddar cheese are quite different in flavour.

## Drink

UK  | US  | Notes
--- | --- | ---
**Cider** | Hard cider | Alcoholic, fermented apple juice.
Apple juice (unfiltered) | **Cider** | Non-alcoholic, often spiced.
**Lemonade** | Sprite | Sprite seems to be a generic enough term that you'll get what you want even if it's not actually Sprite.
Strong beer | Malt Liquor | Usually 6% or above.
Traditional Lemonade | **Lemonade** | Generally not quite as sugary as the UK version, but it depends on region.

Notes:
* A UK pint is about a fifth larger than a US pint.
* US beer is generally slightly stronger than the UK equivalents, sometimes even the same brand.

## Ingredients

UK  | US  | Notes
--- | --- | ---
Caster sugar | Superfine sugar |
Coriander | Cilantro | But you might find the spice version still called coriander.
Cornflour | Cornstarch | There's also a "cornflour" in the US, but it's not what you're looking for.
Double cream | Heavy whipping cream |
Gelatine leaves (6) | Gelatin powder sachet (7g) | You'll also need to pre-soak the powder first and dissolve it.
Icing sugar | Powdered/Confectioner's sugar |
Mince | Ground | e.g. Beef mince is ground beef
Self-raising flour | 150g plain flour + 2tsp baking powder | You can find "self-rising flour" in the US but it has extra salt compared to the UK one, so try to avoid.
Spring onions | Green onions | Or maybe scallions.

Notes:
* A lot of US recipes will measure in cups. 1 US cup is 250ml.
