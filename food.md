# Food & Cooking

## Food

UK  | US  | Notes
--- | --- | ---
Aubergine | Eggplant |
**Bacon** | Back bacon | Almost impossible to find. "Canadian bacon" is somewhat similar.
**Biscuit** | Cookie | Cookie in the US is much more general than in the UK, covering pretty much anything you might call a biscuit.
? | **Biscuit** | A scone-like savoury quickbread, commonly used as a side dish at breakfast.
**Chips** | French/Steak fries | French fries are thin; steak fries are thick.
Courgette | Zucchini |
Crisps | **Chips** | The US also seems to have only 4 boring flavours, too.
Ice Lolly | Popsicle |
Jam | Jelly |
Porridge | (Cooked) Oatmeal |
Prawn | Small shrimp | Don't even ask about prawn cocktail crisps.
Streaky bacon | **Bacon** | The overwhelmingly dominant kind in the US
Sweets | Candy |
Tomato sauce | Ketchup | Ketchup is used in the UK too.
White sauce | **Gravy** | Gravy in the US is a more general term for anything gloopy you pour on food.


## Drink

UK  | US  | Notes
--- | --- | ---
**Cider** | Hard cider | Alcoholic, fermented apple juice
Apple juice (unfiltered) | **Cider** |
**Lemonade** | Sprite | Sprite seems to be a generic enough term that you'll get what you want even if it's not actually Sprite.
Strong beer | Malt Liquor | Usually 6% or above
Traditional Lemonade | **Lemonade** | Generally not quite as sugary as the UK version, but it depends on region.

Notes:
* A UK pint is about a fifth larger than a US pint.

## Ingredients

UK  | US  | Notes
--- | --- | ---
Caster sugar | Superfine sugar |
Coriander | Cilantro | But you might find the spice version still called coriander.
Cornflour | Cornstarch | There's also a "cornflour" in the US, but it's not what you're looking for.
Double cream | Heavy whipping cream |
Gelatine leaves (6) | Gelatin powder sachet (7g) | You'll also need to pre-soak the powder first and dissolve it.
Icing sugar | Powdered/Confectioner's sugar |
Mince | Ground | e.g. Beef mince is ground beef
Self-raising flour | 150g plain flour + 2tsp baking powder | You can find "self-rising flour" in the US but it has extra salt compared to the UK one, so try to avoid.
Spring onions | Green onions | Or maybe scallions.
