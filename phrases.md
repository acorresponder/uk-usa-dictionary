## Compliments

British English relies heavily on sarcasm and self-deprecation, while Americans will
often take things at face value (moreso the further west you are). Some examples:


UK  | Meaning  | Notes
--- | --- | ---
Quite good | Awesome | The more "quite good" is emphasised, the better the thing is.
That's lovely/great | Please stop talking | Generally when someone is telling you something very boring. If "lovely/great" is stressed, though, it means it is actually good.
