# Culture and Government

## Occasions

UK  | US  | Notes
--- | --- | ---
Bank holiday | **Holiday** | They're differently spaced throughout the year, too.
Fortnight | Two weeks | Be warned that "biweekly" can mean fortnightly *or* twice a week.
**Holiday** | Vacation | Often way less of it in the US.


## Medical

UK  | US  | Notes
--- | --- | ---
A&E | ER  |
Doctor's surgery | Doctor's office |
Flu jab | Flu shot | Given to a lot more people in the US.
Paracetamol | Acetaminophen | Yes, these are exactly the same thing.
Plaster | Band-aid |

Notes:
* Intensive care in the US is about 10x larger than in the UK, and so a bit less specialised.


## Education

UK  | US  | Notes
--- | --- | ---
Creche/Nursery school | Pre-school/Pre-K (up to 4 years old), Kindergarten (4-5 years old) | 
Primary school | Elementary school |
Secondary school | Middle school (grades 7 & 8), High school (grades 9 - 12) |
Year | Grade | Grade is UK school year minus one, e.g. Grade 9 = Year 10.


## Politics

UK  | US  | Notes
--- | --- | ---
**MP** | Congressperson | In the US, **MP** means Military Police, so it can get very confusing.
